## File System

- NodeJS is a platform that uses Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, allowing developers to use JavaScript to create server-side applications that generate dynamic content for web clients.
- NodeJS includes a built-in module called FS (File System) that allows users to manage files by creating, reading, deleting, and performing other file operations.
- To use this module, developers can call the "require()" method, which provides access to POSIX function wrapped by NodeJS to enable both synchronous and asynchronous file system operations, depending on the user's requirements.
  var fs = require("fs");

- Synchronous approach involves blocking functions.
- Asynchronous approach involves non-blocking functions.
